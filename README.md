## Car park pricing calculation engine

### Architecture

### Notes

* Since the requirement was just for an "engine" and there was no requirement at this stage to update plans or prices, no database (or subsequent UI) was provided.  The design allows for one to be plugged in easily at a later stage.
* Public classes in the engine are kept at the root level to make them easier to discover by consumers of the library.
